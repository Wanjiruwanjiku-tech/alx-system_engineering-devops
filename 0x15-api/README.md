- APIs are a set of protocols and tools that define methods and data formats that applications use to communicate with each other.

- **In other words, API provide abstraction by hiding all the processes that occur behind the scene.**

- We use APIs everyday without even knowing it.

- Stand for REpresantational State Transfer.

- It  is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.


- Working: A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.
