------------------------------------------------

![devops]()

- DevOps is a set of practices that aims to automate and improve the collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams.


Key principles and practices of DevOps include:
------------------------------------------------

- Collaboration: DevOps emphasizes collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders involved in the software development process.

- Automation: Automation is a core aspect of DevOps. This includes automating repetitive tasks, such as code builds, testing, and deployment, to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

- Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, and automated builds and tests are triggered to ensure that new code changes do not introduce errors.

- Continuous Delivery (CD): Continuous Delivery extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing the necessary tests. This allows for more frequent and reliable releases.


DevOps practices aim to improve the speed of delivery, achieve higher quality software, and foster a more collaborative and innovative environment. Many organizations adopt DevOps to streamline their software development and deployment processes, enabling them to respond more quickly to customer needs and market changes.
